# Surfs Up #

## Overview ##
The purpose of this repository is to check the Temperature statistics for Oahu during the months of June and December and see how they would affect the surf and ice cream shop that W. Avy would be opening to see if the business would be able to be open year round and still make profit.

## Results ##
* There is a significant drop in the minimum temperature between June and December with June being 64 degrees and December being 56 degrees.
* The variation in the two months seems to be close, but the temperatures in December seem to vary more on a day to day basis.
* The average temperature between the two months is only a 3 degree difference with June being around 74 degrees while December's average temperature being around 71 degrees.

## Summary ##
Overall, I believe that if you open the shop up as a dual surf and ice cream shop that it would be profitable year round. The ice cream sales would dip in the colder months, but there seems to be enough days of over 70 degrees to where people will want the ice cream. I don't believe the surf side of the shop would take a hit because people will surf in any weather. The two other queries that I would perform before opening the shop is checking the number of days of rain or inclement weather and with that also how long the weather like that lasted. I would also figure out the tide patterns in the surrounding areas and figure out when to make sales on the surf items in the store to make up for the loss of profit on the ice cream in the later months.
